# Graph-Based Model for Sequence Processing

## Overview
This project implements a graph-based approach to sequence processing using dynamic graph learning, edge weight computation, and message passing mechanisms. It includes components for model training, evaluation, visualization, and utility functions for handling data and configurations.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher

### Install Dependencies
To install the required packages, run:
Install dependencies using:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

### Setting Up and Running the Model
To run the model, follow these steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess datasets using data/load_data.py. For custom datasets, ensure they are properly tokenized and normalized.
2. Configure Experiments: Set up hyperparameters and paths in configs/config.yaml. The configuration can be easily modified for different tasks.
3. Training the Model: Run the training script:

1. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess datasets using ‘data/load_data.py’. For custom datasets, ensure they are properly tokenized and normalized.

2. Configure Experiments: Set up hyperparameters and paths in ‘configs/config.yaml’. The configuration can be easily modified for different tasks.

3. Training the Model: Run the training script:

The training script automatically handles checkpointing, early stopping, and logging.

4. Evaluation and Visualization: Use ‘evaluate/evaluate.py’ to compute metrics like BLEU or accuracy:
   ```bash

   Visualizations of learned graph structures and attention can be generated using:
   ```bash
C.4 Testing and Tuning
Unit Testing: Run unit tests using ‘pytest’:

The tests cover key components like graph layers, data loading, and training loops.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning. You can define parameter grids in ‘configs/default_params.json’ and run tuning experiments:

Integration Testing: End-to-end tests are included in ‘tests/test_integration.py’ to ensure the entire pipeline works smoothly.

## Libraries and Dependencies
The implementation leverages the following key Python libraries:
- **PyTorch**: Core deep learning library for model building and training.
- **PyTorch Geometric**: Provides utilities for working with graph-based models, such as graph layers, pooling, and message passing functions.
- **NetworkX**: Used for graph visualization and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides utilities for preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and data handling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For plotting attention distributions, graph structures, and performance metrics.
- **Hydra/ConfigArgParse**: For managing configurations and hyperparameter tuning via YAML/JSON.

Add the following dependencies to `requirements.txt`:

### Running the Model
Configure the settings: Edit configs/config.yaml to set your desired parameters and paths.
Run experiments: Execute the following command to start experiments:
```bash
python run_experiments.py
```
View Results: Results will be stored in the outputs/ directory as specified in config.yaml.

### Testing
To run the unit tests and integration tests, use:

python -m unittest discover tests
