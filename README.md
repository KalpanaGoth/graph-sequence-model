# Graph-Based Model for Sequence Processing

## Overview
This project implements a graph-based approach to sequence processing using dynamic graph learning, edge weight computation, and message passing mechanisms. It includes components for model training, evaluation, visualization, and utility functions for handling data and configurations.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher

### Install Dependencies
To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Model
Configure the settings: Edit configs/config.yaml to set your desired parameters and paths.
Run experiments: Execute the following command to start experiments:
```bash
python run_experiments.py
```
View Results: Results will be stored in the outputs/ directory as specified in config.yaml.
