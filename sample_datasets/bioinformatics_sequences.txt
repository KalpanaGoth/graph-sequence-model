DNA sequences are composed of nucleotides represented by A, T, C, and G.
Protein structures are determined by amino acid sequences.
Bioinformatics leverages data analysis for understanding biological processes.
Genetic mutations can lead to significant changes in protein function.
Machine learning models help in predicting protein folding.
