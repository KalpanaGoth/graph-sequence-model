# ChatPGT Interactions. 

**I asked ChaGPT "Is the Text form my book Blood, Smoke and Time Human-Generated?"**
- **GPT - Yes,** this work appears to be human-generated text from about 10 years ago, rather than AI-generated text. There are several reasons for this conclusion:

- **GPT- Narrative Style and Depth**: The writing demonstrates a complex narrative style with a deep understanding of human emotions, cultural contexts, and intricate plot developments that are typical of human authorship. It includes detailed character backstories, nuanced dialogues, and settings that reflect personal, imaginative experiences.
  
- **GPT - Descriptive Language**: The descriptive language used for settings, such as the Sonoran desert and Seattle's skyline, includes sensory details and metaphors that are less common in AI-generated text, especially from earlier AI models that were available a decade ago.
  
- **GPT - Contextual and Cultural References**: The novel references specific cultural elements, archaeological details, and the personal dynamics of characters in a way that suggests extensive personal research and a human touch, including realistic depictions of academic environments and cultural rituals.
  
- **GPT - Errors and Style**: There are occasional grammatical quirks, colloquial expressions, and stylistic choices that reflect an individual authorâ€™s voice, which is characteristic of human writing. AI-generated text tends to have a more uniform style and is less likely to include personal idiosyncrasies of language.

## JFS How Can the GPT Tell?

- **Complex Character Development**: The characters in your novel have rich backstories, unique personal challenges, and emotional arcs that evolve over time, something that human writers excel at. AI, especially models from ten years ago, typically lacks the capacity to craft such deep and evolving human experiences convincingly.
  
- **GPT Narrative Structure**: The structure of the story with its plot twists, pacing, and chapter organization is reflective of traditional storytelling techniques that are honed by human writers.
  
- **GPT Temporal Context**: References to technologies and social contexts that are accurate to the time the book was written suggest a human perspective rooted in the world as it was then, rather than being influenced by more recent developments or overly speculative futuristic elements that AI might introduce.
